# CognitoAuthRole

This class represents a custom construct for creating a Cognito authentication role in an AWS CDK application.

## Dependencies:
- `Construct` from `constructs`
- `Role`, `FederatedPrincipal`, `PolicyStatement`, `Effect` from `aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam`
- `CfnIdentityPoolRoleAttachment` from `aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito`

## Properties:
- `role`: An IAM role that will be created for the Cognito authentication.

## Constructor:
### Parameters:
1. `scope` (Type: `Construct`): The parent construct that this construct belongs to.
2. `id` (Type: `string`): A unique identifier for this construct.
3. `props` (Type: `any`): Additional properties required for the Cognito authentication role.

### Code:
```typescript
constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: any) {
    // Constructor implementation
}
```

## Methods:
### Code:
```typescript
    this.role.addToPolicy(
        new iam.PolicyStatement({
            effect: iam.Effect.ALLOW,
            actions: [
                "mobileanalytics:PutEvents",
                "cognito-sync:*",
                "cognito-identity:*",
            ],
            resources: ["*"],
        })
    );
```

## Usage:
```typescript
// Creating an instance of CognitoAuthRole
const cognitoAuthRole = new CognitoAuthRole(this, "MyCognitoAuthRole", {
    identityPool: myIdentityPool,
});
```

In the constructor of `CognitoAuthRole` class, the following actions are performed:
1. The `identityPool` property is extracted from the `props` parameter.
2. An IAM role with the name "CognitoAuthRole" is created with the specified trust policy for the Cognito identity.
3. The role is assigned permissions to perform certain actions using a policy statement.
4. The IAM role is attached to the identity pool using `CfnIdentityPoolRoleAttachment`.

This class can be used to easily create and manage Cognito authentication roles in AWS CDK applications.
