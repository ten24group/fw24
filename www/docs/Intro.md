## Getting Started

Get started by **setting up cli24**.

```shell
npm i @ten24group/cli24
```

## Generate a new site

Generate a new fw24 site with **backend api** and **admin portal** :

```shell
cli24 create myapp
```
This creates myapp-backend and myapp-admin folders.


## Run your back-end in watch mode

Run the development server:

```shell
cd myapp-backend

cli24 watch local
```
