# S3Stack Class Documentation

The `S3Stack` class is responsible for creating and configuring multiple S3 buckets based on the provided configuration. It also handles setting up event triggers for each bucket, such as notifications to Lambda functions or SQS queues.

## Dependencies
- **aws-cdk-lib**: SDK for interacting with AWS Cloud Development Kit
- **aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3**: AWS S3 constructs for CDK
- **aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-notifications**: AWS S3 notification constructs for CDK
- **aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment**: AWS S3 deployment constructs for CDK
- **aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs**: Node.js Lambda function constructs for CDK
- **aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs**: AWS SQS constructs for CDK
- **aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam**: AWS IAM constructs for CDK

## Class: S3Stack
### Properties
- **appConfig**: Optional `IApplicationConfig` object containing application configuration details.
- **mainStack**: Instance of `Stack` where the S3 buckets will be created.

### Constructor
#### `constructor(config: IS3Config[])`
- Initializes the `S3Stack` object.
- Takes an array of `IS3Config` objects as input.
- Prints the provided configuration to the console.
- Calls `Helper.hydrateConfig` method with the provided configuration.

### Methods
#### `construct(appConfig: IApplicationConfig): void`
- Initializes the application configuration.
- Logs a message indicating the start of creating S3 buckets.
- Retrieves the `mainStack` object.
- Calls the `createBuckets` method.

#### `createBuckets(): void`
- Iterates over each `IS3Config` object in the `config` array and calls `createBucket` method with the config.

#### `createBucket(bucketConfig: IS3Config): void`
- Creates a new S3 bucket based on the provided configuration.
- Handles the creation of the bucket, setting public access permissions, source deployment, triggers, and event notifications.

#### `getUniqueName(name: string): string`
- Generates a unique name for the S3 bucket based on the application configuration and account details.

### Internal Methods
- Multiple internal methods are used within the `createBucket` method to handle specific configurations:
    - **Creating bucket:** Creates a new S3 bucket with specified parameters.
    - **Setting public access:** Grants public read access to the bucket if configured.
    - **Deploying sources:** Deploys source files to the bucket if provided.
    - **Handling triggers:** Creates Lambda functions or SQS queues based on trigger events and adds event notifications to the bucket.

## Usage
1. Import the `S3Stack` class.
2. Initialize an instance of `S3Stack` with an array of `IS3Config` objects.
3. Call the `construct` method with the application configuration.
4. The S3 buckets and associated configurations will be created based on the provided input.

Overall, the `S3Stack` class simplifies the process of creating and managing multiple S3 buckets within an AWS CDK application by encapsulating the necessary logic for configuration and deployment.
